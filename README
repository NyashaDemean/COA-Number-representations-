## Notes
This was my first time coding with c so i had quite a lot of challanges. Firstly it was how
i had to open my files and everything from the terminal. this was very confusing because i had to 
look up the commands that would open and link up my files and all. then bit manipulation was also quite some work because of the many numbers. then
for the other stuff it was a bit light as i knew how to do the calculations and knew the methods but specific symbols and characters where confusing 
from time to time.
